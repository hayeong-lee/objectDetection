# Object Detection 

## what is YOLOv5?
 - YOLOv5 ðŸš€ is a family of compound-scaled object detection models trained on the COCO dataset, and includes simple functionality for Test Time Augmentation (TTA), model ensembling, hyperparameter evolution, and export to ONNX, CoreML and TFLite.

 ## PASCAL VOC dataset
  - Pascal VOC is a collection of datasets for object detection. The most commonly combination for benchmarking is using 2007 trainval and 2012 trainval for training and 2007 test for validation. This tutorial will walk through the steps of preparing this dataset for GluonCV.
